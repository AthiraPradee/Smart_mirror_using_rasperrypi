PROJECT OVERVIEW

Project Title: "DIGIREFLECT FOR SMART LIVING USING RASPERRY PI"
**Description:** : AN IOT BASED PROJECT FOR EFFICIENT TASK MANAGEMENT. The Smart Mirror project is an innovative interactive mirror that combines a traditional mirror with a display interface, capable of showing useful information such as time, weather, calendar events, and customized alerts. Equipped with gesture recognition, the smart mirror allows users to interact hands-free, making it an efficient addition to any smart home environment.

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

- **Gesture Recognition**: Detects specific hand gestures to trigger mirror responses (e.g., "yes," "please," "help") using a pre-trained deep learning model.
- **Real-Time Information Display**: Shows real-time updates for date, time, weather, and personalized reminders.
- **Calendar and Event Notifications**: Displays upcoming events, appointments, and reminders.
- **Voice Assistant (Optional)**: Provides an option for voice commands, making it highly accessible and interactive.
- **Modular Design**: Users can customize the displayed information and functionalities based on preferences.
  
TOOLS USED

- **Thonny**: For writing and testing Python code, especially when running scripts on Raspberry Pi.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Used for more extensive coding, debugging, and project management across multiple files and libraries.

TECHNOLOGIES USED

- **Python**: The primary programming language for developing gesture recognition, display, and other functionalities.
- **Raspbian Pi OS**: Operating system on the Raspberry Pi that runs the mirror software.
- **OpenCV**: For computer vision tasks, such as reading frames from the webcam and processing gestures.
- **TensorFlow and Keras**: For deep learning tasks, including loading and using the trained gesture recognition model.
- **tkinter**: Python’s standard GUI library, used for creating the display interface.
  
HARDWARE COMPONENTS

- **Two-Way Mirror**: Acts as both a reflective surface and a display screen.
- **Raspberry Pi Processor**: The core hardware that runs the mirror's OS and software.

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

1. **Setting up the Raspberry Pi**: 
   - Installed and configured Raspbian Pi OS, ensuring all necessary Python libraries were pre-installed (OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, etc.).
   
2. **Gesture Model Preparation**:
   - Created a gesture recognition model using a convolutional neural network, trained with labeled gesture data.
   - Saved the model as `gesture_model.keras` and imported it into the Smart Mirror project.

3. **Loading and Encoding Gestures**:
   - Defined a list of gestures (`['yes', 'please', 'help']`) and used `LabelEncoder` to convert them to a format the model can process.
   
4. **Preprocessing Frames**:
   - Created a function `preprocess_frame` to resize each frame captured by the webcam to (64, 64), normalize pixel values, and prepare the data for gesture prediction.

5. **Capturing Webcam Data**:
   - Used OpenCV to open a connection to the webcam and continuously capture frames.
   
6. **Real-Time Gesture Prediction**:
   - For each captured frame, applied the trained model to predict gestures. Displayed recognized gestures on the mirror interface in real-time.
   
7. **User Interface with tkinter**:
   - Designed a simple, visually appealing UI using `tkinter` to display relevant information like date, time, and weather.
   
8. **Exiting the Program**:
   - Used a 'q' key trigger to close the webcam feed and safely release resources, ensuring a smooth shutdown of the program.

CONCLUSION

- The Smart Mirror project effectively demonstrates the potential of combining AI, computer vision, and user interface design into a practical, real-world application.
- It provides users with a hands-free experience, presenting useful information and recognizing basic gestures, making daily interactions convenient.


FUTURE SCOPE

- **Voice Command Integration**: Enhance the mirror's interactivity by enabling voice command options for more comprehensive control.
- **Extended Gesture Library**: Train the model with additional gestures for expanded functionality, such as controlling smart home devices.
- **IoT Integration**: Allow integration with other smart home devices, enabling actions such as adjusting lighting or temperature based on gestures.
- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Improve the display interface with more customization options and information modules.
- **Facial Recognition for Personalization**: Use facial recognition to display personalized information based on who is looking at the mirror.
